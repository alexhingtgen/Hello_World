Hello!

My name is Alex Hingtgen and I am a junior at the University of Iowa. I am double majoring in accounting and business analytics and aspire to become a CPA when I graduate. In my free time, I enjoy boating on the Mississippi River, skiing, watching sports, and spending time with family and friends. Go Hawkeyes!
